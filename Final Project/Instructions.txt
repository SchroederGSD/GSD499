This folder will contain our final project.  In order to effectively use this
means of sharing our project, we have to follow specific guidelines and procedures.

First, before doing any work on the project that is in this folder, you must sync
up the folder by going through the GitHub application and click sync.

Secound, before altering any existing part of the project, such as code, you must
inform the other member that you will be working on that part.  This is important as
it will cause issues when the second person tries to commit.

Third, after you are done working, you must commit and sync all your changes.

Fourth, do not delete any file without confirming with the other member.

These are the instructions so far.  As the project moves along, more instructions may
be added.  Once you have acknowledged these instructions, add your name and date to
the bottom of this file.
