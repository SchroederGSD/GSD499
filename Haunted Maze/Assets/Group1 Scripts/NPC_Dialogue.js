//"Hello there, you have been brought to the Haunted Maze..
//In order to go home, you must travel the maze to the end gate, but there is a catch...
//the end gate will not open unless you have retrieved the seven diamonds of the lost souls that travel
//through this maze. These lost souls are ghosts that are wandering looking for a new host..
//So to ward them away use this flashlight next to me. 
//Press either "Shift" keys to turn the light on and it will have the ghosts run away, but they will 
//return. The energy of the flashlight is limited so use it wisely. 
//There may be some energy orbs throughout the maze that will help fill the flashlight with more magical light. 
//The orbs will appear at random and disappear at any time.
//Good Luck..."
